Lorenz equations:

- $\frac{dx}{dt} = \sigma (y-x) $
- $\frac{dy}{dt} = x (\rho-z) - y $
- $\frac{dz}{dt} = xy - \beta z $

The equations relate the properties of a two-dimensional fluid layer uniformly warmed from below and cooled from above. In particular, the equations describe the rate of change of three quantities with respect to time: x is proportional to the rate of convection, y to the horizontal temperature variation, and z to the vertical temperature variation
