## Just waves?

I'm going to avoid using Navier-Stokes and fluid mechanics.
Instead, I'm just going to treat waves moving away from a source $\vec{s_i}$ as cosine waves.

Let $\vec{r}$ be the location.

If $|\vec{r} - \vec{s_i}| < v \cdot t$ then $ cos(|\vec{r} - \vec{s_i}|) $ will determine the troughs and crests.

For walls, momentum is perfectly conserved.
