# Tornados

https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ltSGDhi

Basic cylindrical

Each particle has centripetal force (due to low pressure)

Each particle has rotating velocity

Tighter centripetal force at bottom than top



Pass it through a shader. Just rotation (matrix)
However, each sheet of particles are not necessarily aligned.
